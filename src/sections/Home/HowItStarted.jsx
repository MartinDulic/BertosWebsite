            We are two locals, long time friends who have grown up near the sea and spent their whole lives on a 
            boat exploring local sea, hidden bays and caves. While spending countless hours on the sea we decided 
            to turn our passion into business and share our knowledge and provide a unique experience for tourists 
            and visitors to show them the best places in Dalmatia.
